        <br>Hello my name is Moris Menjivar and my major is Political science with International studies. I study politics of American foreign affairs and other affairs of other countries. The subject is very interesting to learn as I start to understand why the world operates in the way it does because if we solely focus on our nation and disregard the bigger picture, then we are bound to make more errors that will impact us in the future. Political science with International studies opens me up to more global opportunities that I would never even thought of or considered like the Peace Corp, the Army, or US ambassador. I would like to help others in need, but on a larger scale and pushing for a better tomorrow. With my major and a little more work experience in the Army, I believe that I can push for this dream of mine to become a reality. 
In the meanwhile, I work as a front desk clerk at the University of California, Riverside. Where I pick up mail, packages, and invoice orders. In addition, I put in orders online for the invoice, make requests for more supplies, and correct changes in the invoices. I always maintain focus on my work and everyday I try to be more efficient than the day before. The work can become difficult as large inboxes of invoice would come in the office time-to-time, but through sheer will and effort, itâ€™ll be done by the end of the day. As a front desk clerk, I am able to learn how to operate Windows Office and Excel then practicing it through actual work related requirements like package tracker and writing out a memo. I also have developed useful skills through my joblike time management and how to destress in a healthy matter which helps me survive college, work, and extra activities like ROTC and the gym.
Working as a front desk clerk is somewhat similar to a job that I already have as a Human Resources Specialist in the Army. Iâ€™ve mentioned earlier that I am in the Army and the experience I have there allows me to learn more things besides my job, which is to take care of soldierâ€™s paperwork which holds all of their life accomplishments and mistakes. What Iâ€™ve learned besides my job is supply management of equipment and leadership skills to lead group of people to operate either on paperwork or down range fighting the enemy. In addition, by joining the Army, I was able to grow as a person to better handle stressful times during work, learned to take initiative, and take responsibility. Iâ€™m in ROTC which is a program that will help me become an officer later in the future and expand more opportunities within the Army. Iâ€™ll also make better pay straight out of college.
As I go through my studies, work, and the Army, I am becoming more and more prepared for big and better jobs that will let me have a better opportunity to create a greater impact on the world for the greater good.
